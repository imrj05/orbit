```

The copy describes the **app** — its features (chat, tools, sessions, find,
providers, plugins, models, usage, appearance) and the steps you take in it
(connect a provider → start a task → watch it work → review → commit), not the
repository's engineering internals.

Screenshots in `public/screens/` are the real app, captured window-only
(rounded corners and shadow, no desktop or menu bar). They are `next/image`-
optimized at runtime; the hero shot is `priority`, the rest lazy-load.

The visual system mirrors the warm.run landing: a 1280px `shell` with hairline
rules down each edge, dashed separators between `band`s, a dark slate page
(`#141518`) with recessed well bands, `#1c1d21` cards, a single blue micro-accent
(`#5b9dff`), and Inter at light weights (250/300/350) with Geist Mono for labels.

Dark is the default. Every colour resolves through CSS variables defined in
`:root` (dark) and `.light`, so a nav toggle can flip the whole site; the
choice is stored in `localStorage` and applied before paint by an inline
script in the root layout.
