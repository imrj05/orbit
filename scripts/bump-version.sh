#
# Bump the app version, roll the changelog, commit, and push (CI tags + builds).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.2
#
# What it does:
#   1. sets the version in both crates + the bundled pi extensions
#   2. refreshes Cargo.lock
#   3. moves CHANGELOG.md's [Unreleased] body under a new [<version>] heading
#   4. commits and pushes to main
#
# The version change is what CI watches: .github/workflows/release.yml sees it,
# builds every platform, creates the annotated tag v<version> at that commit,
# and drafts a GitHub Release on it from CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Env:
#   NO_PUSH=1                 commit locally, but don't push
#   ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG=1   release even when [Unreleased] is empty
#                             (notes then come from the git release log)
