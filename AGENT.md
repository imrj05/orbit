# AGENT.md — Working on Orbit

Project guidance for agents and humans. Read this before touching the repo.

When this file conflicts with `INTENT.md` on architecture choices, **`INTENT.md` wins**.
Update `INTENT.md` if a recorded decision (D1–D6) changes.

## What this project is

**Orbit** is a native desktop workbench for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) —
a chat-style GUI rendered **entirely in Rust** on **GPUI** (Zed's GPU-accelerated UI framework),
speaking the **pi CLI's RPC protocol** directly over stdio.

The reference architecture is [Waku](https://github.com/egoist/waku): native Rust UI on the GPU,
pi as a child process, no web, no webview, no Node daemon.

**Product docs:** `PRODUCT.md` (positioning, capabilities, constraints) · `README.md` (status, setup) ·
`INTENT.md` (decisions and rationale).

## Hard rules

1. **No web anywhere in the UI.** Do not reintroduce React, Vite, Tauri, webviews, DOM, Tailwind, or Node tooling. New UI is GPUI only. The legacy `src-tauri/` tree has been deleted; never rebuild it.
2. **The pi CLI is the only agent runtime.** Spawn `pi --mode rpc` as a child process per open session and speak newline-delimited JSON over stdio (`crates/orbit-rpc`). There is no Node daemon.
3. **GPUI is pre-1.0 and pinned.** `crates/orbit-pi` uses `gpui = { version = "0.2.2", features = ["runtime_shaders"] }`. Upgrade deliberately on a schedule, never track `main`.
4. **Performance is a product requirement.** The transcript and sidebar are virtualized (`list()`). The UI drains RPC events on a ~90 ms heartbeat — never block a frame with I/O. Syntax highlighting, when it lands, must be paint-only so streaming never reflows.
5. **Trust pi's truth.** Render real RPC events and on-disk state; nothing decorative pretending to be functional. Access modes the protocol can't deliver are shown as unavailable (or as a static fact), not faked. The sidebar **Search** row opens the command palette (sessions/commands/settings) — it is not a transcript-content search; do not wire a fake one.
6. **Shipping changes the docs, not just the code.** When a feature ships, update `INTENT.md` → *Implementation status* (and add or revise a `D#` decision when the architecture changed), refresh the `README.md` features/roadmap, and add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` entry. A feature is not done until `INTENT.md` describes it.

                        (browser OAuth until pi ships the server upstream)
contrib/pi-quota-rpc/    apply.mjs + quota-handler.js: inject quota.list into an
                        installed pi build (per-provider usage adapters)
                        quota-handler.test.mjs: node --test coverage of the
                        network-free adapters (unsupported + dispatch)
contrib/orbit-quota-extension/  Orbit's bundled pi extension (loaded with
                        `pi --extension`): fetches quota via pi's own auth and
                        appends normalized `orbit:quota` session entries.
                        adapters.js is the extension twin of quota-handler.js;
                        index.test.mjs / adapters.test.mjs are `node --test`
contrib/orbit-guard-extension/  Orbit's bundled pi extension (loaded with
                        `pi --extension`): hooks `tool_call`, asks the user
                        (via `ctx.ui.select` → `extension_ui_request`) before
                        mutating calls the active access mode does not
                        auto-approve, offering Allow once / Always allow this
                        tool / Deny. policy.js holds the decision table and
                        the `~/.orbit-pi/access-allow.json` allowlist;
                        policy.test.mjs / index.test.mjs are `node --test`
contrib/orbit-title-extension/  Orbit's bundled pi extension (loaded with
                        `pi --extension`): after a session's first turn
                        settles, asks a model for a short title from the
                        first exchange and sets it with `pi.setSessionName`.
                        Reads `~/.orbit-pi/auto-title.json` (the model is the
                        active session model unless Settings → Agent picks
                        one); title.js is the pure helper set and both
                        files are `node --test` covered
contrib/orbit-workflow-extension/  Orbit's bundled pi extension (loaded with
                        `pi --extension`): scopes a session to Plan/Build/Ask.
                        Plan and Ask drop the write tools (`pi.setActiveTools`),
                        gate `bash` to a read-only allowlist on `tool_call`,
                        and inject mode guidance on `before_agent_start`.
                        Reads the per-session mode from `~/.orbit-pi/workflow.json`
                        fresh on every hook; policy.js is the pure decision
                        table and both files are `node --test` covered
assets/icons/           logo-icon.png app-icon source + icon.icns / icon.ico / icon.png

```

Workspace edition is **2021**. Prefer **Rust 1.94+**. Root `Cargo.lock` is the lockfile; ignore a nested `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.lock` if present.

Override the pi binary with `PI_BIN` (default: `pi` on `PATH`).

## Localization (i18n)

UI copy is translated through [rust-i18n](https://github.com/longbridgeapp/rust-i18n).
`locales/en.yml` is the **source of truth** — every key and its English text.
The other nine locale files are generated, never hand-edited:

```
python3 scripts/gen_locales.py        # regenerate locales/*.yml + report gaps
cargo test -p orbit-pi i18n           # completeness guard
```

- **Ships:** English, 简体中文 (`zh-CN`), 日本語 (`ja`), 한국어 (`ko`),
  Español (`es`), Français (`fr`), Deutsch (`de`), Português do Brasil
  (`pt-BR`), Русский (`ru`), Italiano (`it`) — plus `System`, which resolves
  through the OS preferred language (`AppLanguage::from_locale_id`).
- **Call sites:** wrap literals with the crate-root macros — `tr!("key")` for
  plain text, `tr!("key", count = n)` for `%{count}` interpolation, and
  `tr_cow!("key")` only on hot render paths that borrow. Never hard-code
  user-facing English in a render path; add a key instead.
- **Translations** live in `scripts/i18n_glossary*.py`, keyed by the exact
  English string from `en.yml`. Split by surface (core, settings, palette,
  transcript). A string with no entry falls back to English.
- **Keys** are `surface.slug` (`settings.general`, `transcript.thinking`) so a
  translator sees context; identical English can appear under several keys.
- **Native menu:** `set_app_menus` rebuilds the macOS menu bar when the
  language changes (`theme::set_ui_prefs` calls it).
- **Placeholders:** a `ComposerInput` placeholder must be set with
  `.with_placeholder_key("surface.slug")` (plus `.with_placeholder_var` for
  `%{…}` values), not `.with_placeholder(tr!("…"))`. The key resolves at paint
  time, so long-lived search fields (settings/provider/model filters, the
  side pane, git panel, usage page) follow a language change without being
  rebuilt. `.with_placeholder` is only for literal, untranslated text such as
  `sk-…` or a URL example.

### Adding a string

1. Wrap the literal with `tr!("surface.slug")` at the call site.
2. Add `surface.slug: "English"` to `locales/en.yml` (append; keep key order).
3. Add `"English": "translation"` under each locale in the matching
   `scripts/i18n_glossary_*.py`.
4. Run `python3 scripts/gen_locales.py` and `cargo test -p orbit-pi i18n`.

The codemods in `scripts/` (`localize_calls.py`, `localize_settings.py`,
`localize_call_args.py`) wrap common GPUI builder patterns in bulk; run one,
merge its key TSV into `en.yml`, then translate. They skip test code and
`*_tests.rs` on purpose.

## Current state

The product is the GPUI app (`cargo run -p orbit-pi`). The former React/Vite/Tauri
stack is gone; do not resurrect it.

### Shipped architecture

| Area | Source | Current behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Shell | `app.rs`, `view.rs` | Native desktop shell with sidebar, top bar, transcript, composer, status bar, contextual panes, and platform window chrome. |
| Sessions | `sessions.rs`, `app/session.rs` | Reads pi sessions from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`; supports new/open/switch/clone, workspace grouping, parked background processes, and session persistence. |
| RPC | `crates/orbit-rpc/` | One `pi --mode rpc` child per live session, JSONL over stdio, permissive event parsing, typed commands for the currently used protocol surface. |
| Transcript | `transcript.rs`, `transcript_view.rs`, `message_scroller.rs` | Virtualized streaming transcript with tail-following, jump-to-latest, tool activity, markdown/code rendering, find, and error states. |
| Composer | `composer.rs`, `app/composer_ops.rs` | Multiline input, commands, file mentions, image attachments, queued follow-ups, steer, abort, and access/workflow controls. |
| Explorer / Files | `src/explorer/` | Gitignore-aware workspace tree, keyboard navigation, file editor, Markdown/image views, autosave, file operations, and honest binary/oversized/non-UTF-8 states. |
| Review / Git | `review.rs`, `sidepane.rs`, `git.rs`, `git_panel.rs` | Diff review, changed-file navigation, Git status/history/graph, staging, commit, branch operations, and GitHub issue/PR workflows where `gh` is available. |
| Agent controls | `access.rs`, `workflow.rs`, `ai_review.rs`, `reviews.rs` | Supervised/Auto-accept edits/Full access, Plan/Build/Ask workflow modes, and read-only AI reviewer runs (background, per-workspace, persisted). These are extension-backed controls, not a sandbox. |
| Settings | `app/settings.rs`, `providers.rs`, `auth.rs`, `quota.rs`, `skills_ui.rs` | General/runtime/agent/skills/plugins/models/appearance/providers/about/shortcuts plus provider auth, model catalog, quota, skills and plugin management. |
| Native infrastructure | `notifications.rs`, `pi_update.rs`, `app/open_in.rs` | Desktop notifications, pi self-update, open-in-editor/terminal integration, and native menus. |

### Important implementation truths

- Session truth lives in pi's session store and live RPC events.
- Orbit must not fabricate capabilities, metrics, state, provider information, or
  successful operations.
- Access modes are an extension-backed confirmation guard, not a sandbox.
- Plan/Build/Ask are extension-backed workflow modes.
- AI review runs as a separate read-only pi process and must never mutate the active
  session or project.
- Git/file/network work that can block rendering must run off the UI thread.
- Long lists and transcripts must remain virtualized.
- The command palette and keyboard shortcuts must invoke the same underlying actions
  as menus/buttons.
- Theme values come from the shared theme system; components must not introduce
  hardcoded palette values.
- Sizes come from `theme::tokens` (Zed's design tokens, D11): new chrome uses
  `DynamicSpacing` / `TextSize` / `IconSize` / `ButtonSize` / `Radius` and
  `elevation_2` / `elevation_3` instead of px literals. Context menus build on
  `context_menu_surface` / `context_menu_entry` / `context_menu_separator`
  (`app/helpers.rs`).
- Public releases cannot assume the author's providers, models, paths, or machine state.

### Known gaps

- Rewind/fork UI is not shipped; clone is available.
- Full screen-reader/focus accessibility work remains incomplete.
- GPUI API changes must be handled deliberately because the pinned version is
  pre-1.0.
- Mermaid is not natively rendered by GPUI; use the documented fallback until a
  renderer is intentionally added.
- Do not document roadmap work as shipped until it exists in the repository.

## How the app runs

1. `OrbitApp::new` spawns `PiClient::spawn(cwd, None)` so sessions land in pi's default store (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`), shared with the CLI. Tests pass `Some("/tmp/…")` via `--session-dir`.
2. On connect it sends `get_state`, `get_available_models`, `get_available_thinking_levels`.
3. `main.rs` starts a window `spawn` loop: every **90 ms** call `OrbitApp::tick` → `PiClient::drain_events` (`try_recv`, never blocking).
4. Transcript data has two inlets into the same model: `get_messages` rebuilds; `message_start` / `message_update` / `message_end` mutate live.
5. One `PiClient` = one child. Drop kills the process. `ProcessExited` is surfaced in the status line.
6. A few seconds after launch the pi self-update check runs off-thread (`pi_update.rs`): a newer pi installs through `pi update self` and reports via toasts; up-to-date or offline stays quiet.

## GPUI 0.2.2 API notes (learned on this repo — save re-deriving them)

> **Reference: Zed.** Use Zed source code as a reference when a task concerns GPUI implementation — layout and styling idioms, focus and key dispatch, virtualized lists, menus and popovers, window and platform behavior — or when an in-house `src/ui` primitive needs a proven native precedent. Zed is the canonical GPUI codebase; read its crates, and read the gpui revision pinned in `Cargo.toml` so the APIs match what Waku builds against.

These compiled and ran against the pinned version. When in doubt, check
`~/.cargo/registry/src/.../gpui-0.2.2/` (source is the docs) and `examples/` inside it.

- **Bootstrap** (`main.rs`):
  ```rust
  Application::new().with_assets(assets::Assets).run(|cx: &mut App| {
      cx.text_system().add_fonts(vec![/* Cow<[u8]> font bytes */]).unwrap();
      let bounds = Bounds::centered(None, size(px(w), px(h)), cx);
      cx.open_window(WindowOptions {
          window_bounds: Some(WindowBounds::Windowed(bounds)),
          titlebar: Some(TitlebarOptions {
              title: Some(SharedString::from("Orbit Pi")),
              appears_transparent: true,
              traffic_light_position: Some(point(px(12.), px(13.))),
              ..Default::default()
          }),
          focus: true, ..Default::default()
      }, |window, cx| { /* Entity<OrbitApp> */ }).unwrap();
      cx.activate(true);
  });
  ```
  Size the window from `cx.primary_display()` (a hardcoded 1240×840 gets clamped top-left on small/scaled screens). `open_window`'s callback is `FnOnce(&mut Window, &mut App) -> Entity<V>`; create entities with `cx.new(|cx| …)`.
- **App icon:** source is `assets/icons/logo-icon.png`. `icon.icns` is for bundled `.app`s (`package.metadata.bundle`); `scripts/make-dmg.sh` ships it under `dev.orbit.pi`. `cargo run` has no bundle, so `app_icon::set_dock_icon()` calls AppKit `setApplicationIconImage` with the embedded 512 PNG, and Settings → About paints the same PNG via `img(app_icon::ASSET)`. **macOS debug builds swap in the Alpha mark** (`assets/icons/alpha-logo.png` → derived `alpha-logo.icns` + `crates/orbit-pi/dev-assets/alpha-app-icon.png`, regenerated by `scripts/make-alpha-icon.sh`; a debug-only asset overlay, so release binaries do not embed it): `debug_assertions` selects `alpha-app-icon.png` for the Dock and About, and `scripts/run-bundled.sh` builds the separate `Orbit Pi Alpha` / `dev.orbit.pi.alpha` bundle from the Alpha icns. Release builds, DMG, and CI still take the production branches (Windows/Linux debug builds keep the production mark).
- **DMG background:** `assets/icons/background_660x400.tiff` is generated from the master art `assets/icons/background_660x400.png` by `scripts/make-dmg-background.sh`, which bakes a frosted label plate behind each icon. Finder draws icon-view labels in **black** whenever the window has a background picture or colour (only the default background adapts to Dark Mode; no `.DS_Store`/AppleScript field controls label colour), so the dark art has to carry the light area the labels sit on rather than relying on white text. Plate positions must track `DMG_APP_X`/`DMG_DROP_X`/`DMG_ICON_Y` in `scripts/make-dmg.sh`.
- **macOS chrome:** `appears_transparent` + `traffic_light_position` — no objc2. Drag regions: `.window_control_area(WindowControlArea::Drag)` on the sidebar strip and the top-bar spacer. When the sidebar is hidden, pad the top bar so controls clear the traffic lights (`pl` ≈ 76 px).
- **Virtualized lists** (transcript **and** sidebar):
  - Transcript uses `message_scroller.rs` (`ListAlignment::Bottom`, 400px overdraw) — 0.2.2 has no `FollowMode::Tail`, so a past-the-end `scroll_to` is the equivalent. Append while following sticks to the live edge; `remeasure_items` grows the streaming row; scroll away shows **Jump to latest**.
  - Rows are plain GPUI flex trees in `transcript_view.rs` (the `Message` component port was removed — no component library anywhere): Start/End alignment, avatar disc, content column, footer. The footer sits outside the avatar row so the 32px disc stays flush with content; the footer is indented `avatar + row gap` to line up with the content column.
  - Sidebar: `ListState::new(count, ListAlignment::Top, overdraw_px)`.
  - `list(state.clone(), move |ix, window, cx| … .into_any_element())` — the closure is `'static`, so capture `Rc<RefCell<_>>` / `Rc<Vec<_>>`, never `&self`.
  - Stick-to-latest: `scroll_to(ListOffset { item_ix: len, offset_in_item: px(0.) })` (past-the-end).
  - Pin tracking: `set_scroll_handler` — for `Bottom` alignment, `is_scrolled` is "not at bottom", and it only fires for real user scrolls, not programmatic `scroll_to`.
- **`list()` needs a definite height:** default `ListSizingBehavior` is **`Auto`** (no intrinsic height). As a plain block child it lays out at height 0 → `prepaint_items` clears its item list → **nothing paints** (while request_layout's overdraw probe still renders ~3 items — the telltale symptom). Fix: `.h_full()` on the list inside a `flex_1` + `min_h_0` parent. Never wrap a `list()` in an outer `overflow_y_scroll()` div — the list scrolls itself.
- **Heartbeat / async:** `window.spawn(cx, async move |cx: &mut AsyncWindowContext| { loop { Timer::after(dur).await; view.update(cx, |this, cx| this.tick(cx)).ok(); } }).detach()`. `AsyncWindowContext` derefs to `AsyncApp` and implements `AppContext`. `pub use smol::Timer` is at the gpui crate root.
- **Rendering:** `impl Render { fn render(&mut self, _window: &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement }`.
- **Events:** handlers are `cx.listener(Self::method)`; the listener bound is `Fn(&Event, &mut Window, &mut App)` (not `Context<T>`). `.hover(|s| …)` for hover styles.
- **Text wrapping:** `.whitespace_normal()` exists in 0.2.2 and is what the assistant transcript uses. There is still **no `WhiteSpace::PreWrap`**. For preformatted blocks (thinking, code), render **one `div()` per line** with a fixed height (e.g. `div().h(px(17.)).child(line)`).
- **Any-elements:** `.into_any()` is on `Element` (concrete types); on an opaque `impl IntoElement` return use `.into_any_element()`.
- **Custom text input:** there is no multi-line editor widget we use. `ComposerInput` is an `EntityInputHandler` adapted from gpui's `input` example (grapheme-aware caret, clipboard, IME stubbed). Keep it single-line until a deliberate composer upgrade (INTENT.md risk #3).
- **Key-binding precedence:** bindings are ordered by dispatch-tree depth (deepest/focused node first); ties at the same depth break by **registration order (later wins)**. Bindings with no context count as the deepest depth. The picker filter uses `.with_key_context("Composer Picker")` so backspace still edits, and picker `enter`/`escape`/`arrows` are registered **after** composer bindings in `main.rs` so they win over `Submit` / `AbortRun`.
- **Popovers:** `anchored().position_mode(AnchoredPositionMode::Local).anchor(Corner::BottomLeft).offset(…).snap_to_window()` + `deferred(entity)` paints a floating popup. `on_mouse_down_out` dismisses. **Click-through:** the same click's mouse-up would re-open the chip — `OrbitApp` swallows toggles for ~200 ms after an outside mouse-down dismiss (`menu_dismissed_at`). Layered `BoxShadow`es (`vec![contact, ambient]`) read as a real modal surface.
- **Picker lists:** **do not use `uniform_list` inside a `deferred` + `anchored` popover** — measured layout can collapse to height 0. Use `max_h` + `overflow_y_scroll` + `ScrollHandle` (Zed `ContextMenu` shape). Keyboard nav must `set_offset` to keep the highlighted row in view. `.on_hover` / `.on_click` live on *stateful* elements (`.id(...)` required).
- **Assets:** implement `gpui::AssetSource` over `include_dir!` so packaged builds don't depend on cwd. SVG icons: `img("icons/….svg")` via helpers in `app.rs`. Provider marks live under `assets/icons/providers/`.
- **Fonts:** `cx.text_system().add_fonts` for embedded `Symbols Nerd Font` (devicons) and the curated catalog under `assets/fonts/bundled/`. `assets::register_zed_fonts` loads IBM Plex Sans / Lilex; `assets::register_bundled_fonts` recursively loads the bundled faces so `theme::UI_FONTS` / `CODE_FONTS` resolve without an OS dependency. Each family is a statically instanced, subset 400/500/600/700 TTF with a normalized name table (one typographic family, unique PostScript names) so font-kit weight selection works.

## Pi CLI RPC protocol (official spec)

- Start: `pi --mode rpc [--provider …] [--model …] [--name …]` — see `packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` in the pi repo.
- **Framing is strict JSONL, LF only.** Split on `\n`; strip a trailing `\r`; never use a reader that splits on `U+2028/U+2029`. `PiClient` uses `read_until(b'\n')`.
- **Typed in `CommandBody` today:** `prompt` (with `images` + `streamingBehavior`), `abort`, `clear_queue`, `steer`/`follow_up` (with `images`), `set_steering_mode`/`set_follow_up_mode`, `compact`, `set_auto_compaction`/`set_auto_retry`/`abort_retry`, `set_session_name`, `new_session`, `switch_session`, `get_state`, `get_messages`, `get_available_models`, `set_model`, `cycle_model`, `get_available_thinking_levels`, `set_thinking_level`, `cycle_thinking_level`, `get_commands`, `get_session_stats`, `get_fork_messages`, `fork`, `clone`, `auth.list`, `auth.status`, `auth.login`, `auth.logout`, `auth.cancel`, plus `Raw(Value)` for anything else.
- **Used by the UI today:** `prompt`/`follow_up` (text + images), `abort`, `clear_queue`, `set_follow_up_mode`, `compact`, `set_auto_compaction`/`set_auto_retry`/`abort_retry`, `set_session_name`, `new_session`, `switch_session`, `get_state`, `get_messages`, `get_entries` (bridge quota snapshots, incremental `since` cursor), `get_available_models`, `set_model`, `get_available_thinking_levels`, `set_thinking_level`, `get_session_stats`, and the `auth.*` family when the running pi advertises it (falls back to file/Terminal login otherwise). `SessionState` reads `steeringMode`/`followUpMode`/`autoCompactionEnabled`/`sessionName`/`isCompacting`/`pendingMessageCount` from `get_state`; `PendingQueue` mirrors `queue_update`. `steer` is sent by the composer's steer controls; `clone` by ⌘P. `set_steering_mode`, `cycle_model`, `cycle_thinking_level`, `get_fork_messages`, and `fork` remain typed but unwired.
- **Not typed / not wired yet:** `get_tree`, `bash`/`abort_bash`, `export_html`, `get_last_assistant_text`, and `new_session.parentSession`.
- **Error handling:** a `response` with `success: false` carries an `error` string. The app never swallows it: `on_command_failure` surfaces it in a dismissible error banner (chat and settings) and re-reads `get_state` to reconcile optimistic UI after `set_model`/thinking/rename failures. A `parse` command, `extension_error` events, failed compaction (`compaction_end.errorMessage`), exhausted `auto_retry_end`, and `send` write failures all route to the same banner. A successful retry of the same command clears its banner (`clear_error_for`). **Provider/LLM failures are not responses at all**: pi sets `stopReason: "error"` + `errorMessage` on the final assistant message and emits it via `message_start`/`message_end` (see pi-agent-core `agent-loop.js`). `transcript::message_error` extracts it; the app raises `Agent error: …` and `transcript_view` renders the same text as a red card inline, so a failed turn is never an empty row.
- Events → stdout JSON lines: `agent_start/end/settled`, `turn_start/end`, `message_start/update/end` (`assistantMessageEvent`: `text_delta`, `thinking_delta`, `toolcall_start/delta/end`), `tool_execution_*`, `bash_execution_update`, `queue_update`, `compaction_*`, `auto_retry_*`, `extension_ui_request`, `extension_error`, typed `auth.*` (`Event::Auth`), plus `Unknown` for forward-compat.
- **Provider authentication:** `auth.*` is a first-class RPC namespace. The client reducer is `orbit-pi/src/auth.rs`; the wire types are in `orbit-rpc/src/types.rs`; the server contract (which pi must implement by reusing its provider OAuth + `auth.json`) is `crates/orbit-rpc/docs/auth-rpc.md`. Tokens never cross RPC or GPUI state. **Stock pi 0.85.1 has no server side** — without it Orbit falls back to `pi /login` in Terminal. To get browser OAuth on an installed pi now, run `node contrib/pi-auth-rpc/apply.mjs` (idempotent; `--revert` restores the backup) and restart the agent. `auth_fake_pi.rs` covers the round trip against a scripted server.
- **Provider quota:** `quota.list` is the account-usage sibling of `auth.*`. The client reducer is `orbit-pi/src/quota.rs`; the wire types (`QuotaReport`/`QuotaWindow`/`QuotaBalance`/`QuotaKind`) are in `orbit-rpc/src/types.rs`; the server contract is `crates/orbit-rpc/docs/quota-rpc.md`. pi resolves the credential, verifies the provider origin, rejects redirects, and returns only normalized percentages/counts/resets/amounts — no token, key, or account id. Coverage follows `@narumitw/pi-usage`'s verified reference: Anthropic, ChatGPT Codex, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, MiniMax, Z.AI, OpenCode Go, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, DeepSeek, Moonshot, xAI, Fireworks, Baseten. Google/Gemini is registered explicitly as `unsupported` (no account-quota API — AI Studio-only). **Ollama Cloud** has a real adapter for both billing generations: the current monthly-credit model via `GET https://ollama.com/api/usage` with a user-supplied cloud API key, and the legacy 5-hour/weekly model via the authenticated `ollama.com/settings` page parsed behind an isolated `OllamaCloudParser` with a user-supplied session cookie. Credentials are explicit (`auth.json`, 0600; type `api_key` or `ollama_cloud_session`), entered in Settings → Providers → Ollama; the local `models.json` placeholder is never sent to ollama.com and browser cookies are never auto-extracted. Every other provider reports `unsupported`. Reports are per-provider cached 60 s (these endpoints rate-limit). **The default path needs no patch:** `bundled_extensions.rs` materializes the bundled `contrib/orbit-quota-extension/` under `~/.orbit-pi/quota-extension/` and every session process is spawned with `pi --extension <index.js>`; the extension fetches through pi's `ctx.modelRegistry`, appends one `orbit:quota` custom entry **only when the snapshot changes** (never in LLM context), and the app polls `get_entries` with a per-session `since` cursor (60 s, plus `agent_settled`, throttled by `QUOTA_ENTRY_POLL_INTERVAL`). Entry ids are per-session: the cursor resets on a `sessionId` change, a dead cursor is dropped and re-read, and bridge data never flips `QuotaSupport` (so a patched pi is still probed). `node contrib/pi-quota-rpc/apply.mjs` remains available for the `quota.list` server side; `quota_fake_pi.rs` covers the round trip and `--extension` forwarding, and `contrib/orbit-quota-extension/*.test.mjs` (run `node --test`) covers the bridge end to end offline, and `contrib/pi-quota-rpc/quota-handler.test.mjs` covers the patch adapters.
- **User interaction:** `extension_ui_request` (`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor`; also fire-and-forget `notify`/`setStatus`/`setWidget`/`setTitle`) on stdout; answer with `extension_ui_response` on stdin. `dialog.rs` + `app/dialogs.rs` render the dialog methods as a blocking modal card and reply (`cancelled` on Escape/scrim). `notify` renders as an in-app toast, `setStatus` surfaces on the status bar, and `set_editor_text` seeds the composer; `setWidget`/`setTitle` are terminal chrome and ignored. `ask_user_question`'s multi-select arrives as an `input` of comma-separated option numbers (pi's RPC fallback), so it is selectable too.
- Envelopes parse **loosely**; unknown shapes flow through as raw JSON so protocol additions don't crash the client.
- **Access guard (resolved without the protocol):** pi has no built-in per-tool permission surface in RPC mode and no sandbox (`pi docs/security.md`); its only tool gate is an extension's `tool_call` hook. Orbit ships one (`contrib/orbit-guard-extension/`) that prompts for mutating calls through `ctx.ui.select` — Allow once / Always allow this tool / Deny — which *does* surface over RPC as an `extension_ui_request` and renders as Orbit's inline approval bar. `--approve`/`--no-approve` remain **project trust** (load project-local settings/extensions/skills), a separate concern not yet wired to the access chip. There is no "Auto"/AI-reviewer mode: the installed pi exposes no `modelRegistry.streamSimple` for extensions, so shipping one would be fake.

## Definition of done (whole migration)

Every feature in `PRODUCT.md` → `Capabilities` runs natively in the GPUI app against the pi CLI with the same behavior as the legacy UI; legacy `src-tauri` deleted; `cargo run -p orbit-pi` is the only way to launch.

**For an individual feature:** it runs natively in GPUI against the pi CLI, `cargo build --workspace` stays clean, tests cover the happy path, and the docs describe it — `INTENT.md` → *Implementation status* (plus a `D#` decision when the architecture changed), the `README.md` features/roadmap, and a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` entry. Update these in the same change that ships the feature, never as a follow-up.

## Verification

- `cargo build --workspace` must stay clean (zero warnings) after every change.
- `cargo test --workspace` — unit tests + live pi integration tests. `live_pi.rs`, `live_catalog.rs`, and the other live tests skip when `pi` is missing; `orbit-pi` session-store tests skip when `~/.pi/agent/sessions` is empty. CI runs build + clippy on macOS (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); tests run locally.
- Run the app: `cargo run -p orbit-pi`. Check: sessions list from disk, new session (`cmd-n`), prompt streams into the transcript, model/thinking pickers, abort (`escape`), settings (`cmd-,`), sidebar toggle. Notifications need an app bundle — `scripts/run-bundled.sh` builds the debug binary into the ad-hoc-signed `Orbit Pi Alpha` (bundle id `dev.orbit.pi.alpha`, Alpha icon) and opens it.
- Windows: the same `cargo run -p orbit-pi` builds and runs (GPUI renders through DXGI here). `gpui`'s default `windows-manifest` feature is off in `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.toml` — it links a second `RT_MANIFEST` resource beside the one `build.rs` embeds, and CVTRES fails the link with `CVT1100: duplicate resource`. `scripts/bundle-windows.ps1` builds the Inno Setup installer (`scripts/installer/orbit-pi.iss`); it needs Inno Setup 6 (`ISCC.exe`) and, per-user under `%LocalAppData%\Programs`, no elevation. Desktop notifications and the alert sound are still macOS-only stubs. Window chrome is the app's own: the header row carries minimize / maximize / close, drawing a restore glyph when `window.is_maximized()`, and the header strips drag the window through `platform::start_window_drag`. Check them by clicking — `IsIconic`/`IsZoomed` flip, closing exits the process — and check dragging by pressing a header strip and moving the pointer; both were broken while the presses were routed through GPUI's `WindowControlArea` path, which this app's focusable root makes unusable (see the Shell row).
- No `unsafe` without a comment; no new dependencies without a stated reason.

## GPUI 0.2.2 implementation notes

Use the pinned GPUI source in `~/.cargo/registry/src/.../gpui-0.2.2/` and the repository's
existing code as the primary API reference. Zed is a useful architectural precedent, but
do not copy behavior that conflicts with Orbit's product or design rules.

Important constraints:

- `list()` needs a definite height and scrolls itself; do not wrap it in another
  scrolling container.
- Virtualized lists should use the existing list/scroller patterns in this repository.
- UI callbacks must not block on I/O.
- Use the repository's `ComposerInput` / `EntityInputHandler` for text input rather
  than introducing another editor abstraction without a deliberate decision.
- Popovers should use the existing anchored/deferred pattern and dismiss correctly
  on outside interaction.
- Keep focus and keybinding precedence explicit; focused controls must win over global
  bindings.
- Use the repository's `AssetSource` and theme/font registration for packaged assets.
- Prefer existing GPUI primitives and local helpers before introducing a component
  library or new abstraction.
- When a GPUI API is uncertain, inspect the pinned crate source rather than guessing.

## Pi CLI RPC protocol

Orbit communicates with pi using newline-delimited JSON over stdio.

- Start sessions with `pi --mode rpc`; `PI_BIN` may override the executable.
- Framing is strict JSONL with LF delimiters. Preserve permissive parsing for forward
  compatibility.
- Use typed commands/events for protocol features Orbit actively depends on; unknown
  commands/events should not crash the client.
- Surface failed RPC responses instead of swallowing them.
- Provider/agent failures may arrive as assistant message error state rather than a
  normal RPC response; render the error in the session.
- `extension_ui_request` is the RPC bridge for bundled extension dialogs and approvals.
- Provider auth and quota are optional capabilities; never assume every pi build
  implements them.
- Access control is implemented by Orbit's bundled extension. `--approve`/`--no-approve`
  is project trust, not a replacement for Orbit's access modes.
- There is no sandbox. Do not describe the access guard as one.
- Do not implement an AI "Auto" access mode until pi exposes the required extension API.

## Plan (P0–P6) — see `INTENT.md` for decisions, rationale, estimates, and phase gates

### P0 — Transport probe + foundation (mostly done)
1. ✅ RPC framing + `get_state` against real pi; live prompt streaming (`agent_start → text → agent_settled`).
2. ✅ Root `Cargo.toml` workspace (`orbit-pi`, `orbit-rpc`).
3. ✅ Process spawner: `crates/orbit-rpc/src/client.rs` (per-session process, kill-on-drop, stderr ring).
4. ✅ Rust RPC client: permissive serde types + JSONL reader/writer threads.
5. ✅ First live round-trip in the real window (no more `live.rs` spike / mock tab).
6. ✅ Extension dialogs (`extension_ui_request`: `select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor`) render natively and block the run until answered. ✅ Access guard: the bundled extension confirms tool calls per the active mode (no protocol permission surface needed).

### P1 — Shell & theme (mostly done; theme persistence still open)
- ✅ Window, top bar, macOS traffic lights (`TitlebarOptions.traffic_light_position`).
- ✅ Dark zinc palette (hardcoded in `app.rs`, Waku-like). ⬜ `Theme` entity, light mode, accent, density, persist to pi settings.
- ✅ Sidebar + sessions grouped by workspace; ⬜ Search.
- ✅ Keybindings / focus for composer + picker; ✅ native macOS menu bar (App/File/Edit/View); ⬜ broader native dialogs.
- ✅ Curated embedded font catalog (Inter, Fixel Text, Geist, Atkinson, Source Sans 3, Roboto, Noto Sans, DM Sans, Manrope, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Geist Mono, Commit Mono, Source Code Pro, Cascadia Code, Roboto Mono, Iosevka, DM Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Inconsolata, Noto Sans Mono, Space Mono, Anonymous Pro, Martian Mono).

### P2 — Data layer (substantially done)
- ✅ Permissive command/event models.
- ✅ Sessions: list, open, switch, new, **clone** (⌘P), delete, cross-workspace, over an Orbit-owned project list (remove a workspace from the sidebar without deleting pi's sessions). ⬜ rewind (`fork`) needs entry-id plumbing; rename lives in the session-details popover and stays active-session-only.
- ✅ Catalog: `get_available_models`, thinking levels, plus a **Models** settings page.
- ✅ Workbench readers: skills, plugins, usage history, on-disk model/provider CRUD.
- ✅ Settings persistence to `~/.orbit-pi/` (`theme`, `ui.json`, `fonts.json`, `favorites.json`, `notifications.json`, `layout.json`). ⬜ scoped-models file I/O.

### P3 — Core chat (bulk done)
- ✅ Virtualized transcript, stick-to-latest. ⬜ stream veil (Waku `md/veil.rs`).
- ✅ Event drain on the ~90 ms heartbeat coalesces commits. ⬜ explicit ≤8.3 Hz streaming pipeline.
- ✅ Markdown: GFM tables/lists/alerts, one `StyledText` per block, highlight-as-paint, copyable code blocks.
- ✅ Multi-line composer, file attach → base64 images, `/`-command + `@`-file autocomplete, **steer**.
- ✅ Extension dialogs (`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor`) as a native modal. ⬜ richer per-tool renderers (bash/thinking dedicated; edit/todo/plan/search/mcp are generic). ✅ tool approval via the access guard's confirm dialog.
- ✅ Diff viewer + per-turn `Last Turn` checkpoints; ✅ image lightbox. Changed files render in the tail summary card **by design** (not per message). ✅ ⌘F transcript find.

### P4 — Workbench (substantially done)
- ✅ Git page (Changes / History / Graph + commit bar, commit-message generation). ✅ Providers: built-in catalog, API-key + OAuth, models.json CRUD, refresh. ✅ Skills, ✅ Plugins (+ search), ✅ **Models** page, ✅ Usage charts + filters + export. ✅ Theme/UI persistence (Orbit store). ✅ Explorer: left project panel (gitignore-aware tree, git badges, filter, hidden toggle) + full-page Files editor (editable, syntax-highlighted code/text with debounced autosave; markdown/image; binary/size guards) + file operations (New File/Folder, Rename, Delete-to-Trash).

### P5 — Mermaid + accessibility (partial)
- ✅ Mermaid fences stay copyable code blocks with an honest label (never faked). ✅ Reduce-motion setting honored by shimmer/spinners/drop fade. ✅ tool approval (`tool_call` guard + access modes; not a sandbox). ⬜ focus rings / screen-reader labeling.

### P6 — Test & ship (partial)
- ✅ Unit + live tests (skip cleanly without `pi`), ✅ 10k-message model-layer perf test, ✅ signed `.app`/DMG + optional notarization/stapling, ✅ GitHub Actions CI. ⬜ on-device scroll-perf benchmark, streaming state-machine edge coverage.

## Definition of done (whole migration)

Every feature in `PRODUCT.md` → `Capabilities` runs natively in the GPUI app against the pi CLI with the same behavior as the legacy UI; legacy `src-tauri` deleted; `cargo run -p orbit-pi` is the only way to launch.

**For an individual feature:** it runs natively in GPUI against the pi CLI, `cargo build --workspace` stays clean, tests cover the happy path, and the docs describe it — `INTENT.md` → *Implementation status* (plus a `D#` decision when the architecture changed), the `README.md` features/roadmap, and a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` entry. Update these in the same change that ships the feature, never as a follow-up.

## Verification

- `cargo build --workspace` must stay clean (zero warnings) after every change.
- `cargo test --workspace` — unit tests + live pi integration tests. `live_pi.rs`, `live_catalog.rs`, and the other live tests skip when `pi` is missing; `orbit-pi` session-store tests skip when `~/.pi/agent/sessions` is empty. CI runs build + clippy on macOS (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); tests run locally.
- Run the app: `cargo run -p orbit-pi`. Check: sessions list from disk, new session (`cmd-n`), prompt streams into the transcript, model/thinking pickers, abort (`escape`), settings (`cmd-,`), sidebar toggle. Notifications need an app bundle — `scripts/run-bundled.sh` builds the debug binary into the ad-hoc-signed `Orbit Pi Alpha` (bundle id `dev.orbit.pi.alpha`, Alpha icon) and opens it.
- Windows: the same `cargo run -p orbit-pi` builds and runs (GPUI renders through DXGI here). `gpui`'s default `windows-manifest` feature is off in `crates/orbit-pi/Cargo.toml` — it links a second `RT_MANIFEST` resource beside the one `build.rs` embeds, and CVTRES fails the link with `CVT1100: duplicate resource`. `scripts/bundle-windows.ps1` builds the Inno Setup installer (`scripts/installer/orbit-pi.iss`); it needs Inno Setup 6 (`ISCC.exe`) and, per-user under `%LocalAppData%\Programs`, no elevation. Desktop notifications and the alert sound are still macOS-only stubs. Window chrome is the app's own: the header row carries minimize / maximize / close, drawing a restore glyph when `window.is_maximized()`, and the header strips drag the window through `platform::start_window_drag`. Check them by clicking — `IsIconic`/`IsZoomed` flip, closing exits the process — and check dragging by pressing a header strip and moving the pointer; both were broken while the presses were routed through GPUI's `WindowControlArea` path, which this app's focusable root makes unusable (see the Shell row).
- No `unsafe` without a comment; no new dependencies without a stated reason.
