//! The usage model: one normalized record per billable agent action, plus the
//! interning tables every query joins against.
//!
//! # Where this data comes from
//!
//! Orbit never invents usage. Every number on the Usage page is derived from
//! pi's own session store (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<workspace-slug>/*.jsonl`),
//! the same files the CLI writes and the sidebar lists. Two entry shapes carry
//! all of it:
//!
//! - `{"type":"message", "message":{"role":"assistant", "usage":{…}}}`
//!   → one [`UsageRecord`] (one model request).
//! - `{"type":"message", "message":{"role":"toolResult", …}}` matched to the
//!   `toolCall` block that produced it → one [`ToolRun`].
//!
//! # Accounting rules
//!
//! These definitions are the contract for every aggregate in
//! [`super::aggregate`]. They are stated once, here, and never re-derived in a
//! view.
//!
//! - **Request** — one assistant message that carries a `usage` object: one
//!   round trip to a model provider. A request that pi records with no tokens
//!   and no cost is not counted (nothing was billed, nothing to show).
//! - **Agent turn** — one user message: one prompt you sent. A turn contains
//!   one or more requests (a tool loop makes several).
//! - **Tool run** — one `toolCall` block, paired with its `toolResult`.
//! - **Bash execution** — a tool run whose tool is `bash`.
//! - **Total tokens** — pi's own `usage.totalTokens`, which equals
//!   `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` on every record we have ever
//!   seen; the four-bucket sum is used when `totalTokens` is absent. Cache
//!   tokens are therefore *included* in the total, and the composition
//!   (input/output/cache read/cache write) sums to it exactly.
//! - **Reasoning tokens** — a *subset of* `output` when a provider reports
//!   them; never added to the total (that would double-count).
//! - **Cache hit rate** — `cache_read / (cache_read + input)`, matching
//!   [`orbit_rpc::SessionUsage::cache_read_percent`]. `input` is the uncached
//!   prompt; a request with no prompt tokens has no rate and is excluded.
//! - **Cost** — pi's own per-message `cost.total`. Providers without a pricing
//!   table report `0`, which is indistinguishable from "genuinely free", so a
//!   model counts as *priced* only if some request for it reported a positive
//!   cost. Cost aggregates report their coverage so a partial total never
//!   masquerades as a complete one.
//! - **Duration** — wall-clock generation time, derived from the session
//!   file's entry timestamps: `write_time(assistant) − write_time(previous
//!   entry)`, i.e. from the prompt (or tool result) being handed to the
//!   provider until the reply was recorded. Gaps over [`IDLE_GAP_MS`] are
//!   treated as idle/sleep and excluded rather than reported as latency.
//! - **Tool duration** — `write_time(toolResult) − write_time(toolCall)`.
//! - **Errors** — a request whose `stopReason` is `error`. `aborted` (the user
//!   stopped the run) is tallied separately; a tool failure is an error on the
//!   tool run, not on the request.
//! - **Retries** — *not* in the session files: pi's automatic retries are only
//!   visible as live RPC events, so the page reports retry data as
//!   unavailable rather than guessing from error sequences.
//! - **Workspace / project** — pi records one dimension, the session's `cwd`.
//!   The page calls it "workspace"; there is no separate project level in the
//!   data, so project-level analytics are workspace-level analytics.
