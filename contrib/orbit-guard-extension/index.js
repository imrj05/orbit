/**
 * Orbit's access-mode guard (pi extension).
 *
 * Orbit loads this file with `pi --extension <path>` on every session it
 * spawns. It hooks pi's `tool_call` event — which runs after a tool call is
 * proposed and can block it — and, for any mutating call the active access
 * mode does not auto-approve, asks the user through `ctx.ui.select()`. In RPC
 * mode that becomes an `extension_ui_request`; Orbit renders it as an inline
 * bar above the composer and answers it over stdin.
 *
 * The offered options are Allow once / Always allow this tool / Deny.
 * "Always allow" is recorded per mode in `~/.orbit-pi/access-allow.json`. The
 * mode lives in `~/.orbit-pi/access.json` and is read fresh on every tool
 * call, so a change in Orbit re-arms live sessions with no restart. See
 * `policy.js` for the decision table.
 *
 * Fail-safe: if no UI is available to confirm (print/json mode) or the prompt
 * throws/returns nothing, the call is blocked rather than allowed.
